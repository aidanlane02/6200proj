USACE Data Disclaimer: These data are furnished with the understanding that the U.S. Army Corps of 
Engineers makes no warranties concerning the accuracy; reliability; or suitability of this data for any particular 
purpose.
Outflow; Spill; Inflow; and Scroll Case Temperature in degrees Celsius are collected at the project. DART calculates Spill Percent from the Spill and Outflow values at the project.
Temperature; Barometric Pressure; Dissolved Gas and Dissolved Gas Percent are measured at Water Quality Monitoring stations in the forebay and tailwater of most projects and other key locations in the basin. Prior to 1995; these data are from a variety of sources within the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
Turbidity is measured in the forebay or in a fish ladder at a project.
Elevation is measured in the forebay and tailwater of a project.
